CCLE multi-omics data is ensembled into a [`MultiAssayExperiment`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiAssayExperiment.html) (R BioC).

Current omics added are: see [raw/README.md](raw/README.md) for details.

Visit [INSTALL.md] to setup the environment. Then run
```
conda activate envs/mae
make
# 1. Download multi-omics data files

```
